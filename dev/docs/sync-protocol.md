- `Setup`
	- leader function
		- get elected as a leader
		- create and register public params to: `leaders/<function-revision>/publicParams`
		- create and register public key to: `leaders/<function-revision>/publicKey`
	- member function
		- become a member
		- once it know it isn't the leader 
			- wait for leader's public params from: `leaders/<function-revision>/publicParams`
			- create its key pair and register its public key to: `members/<function-revision>/<leader-pod-id>/<pod-id>/publicKey`
- --
- `Leader Re-election`
	- leader
		- create your own public params and update the leader's public params for your function: `leaders/<function-revision>/publicParams`
		- create and register public key to: `leaders/<function-revision>/publicKey`
	- member
		- get the new leader's public params from: `leaders/<function-revision>/publicParams`
		- create new key pair and register its public key to: `members/<function-revision>/<leader-pod-id>/<pod-id>/publicKey`
	- re-encryption key generation
		- watch for registered public keys `members/<function-revision>/<leader-pod-id>/*/publicKey`
---
- `ReEncryption Key Generation`
	- leader
		- watch the key prefix: `members/<function-revision>/<leader-pod-id>/*/publicKey`
		- for every new `publicKey` create a re-encryption key (allowing member function to re-encrypt the ciphertext meant for leader to itself)
		- register the re-encryption key for the member to: `members/<function-revision>/<leader-pod-id>/*/reEncryptionKey`
	- member
		- watch the key prefix: `members/<function-revision>/<leader-pod-id>/<pod-id>/reEncryptionKey`

- What does a function needs to encrypt message?
	- the actual message
	- the next function the message is meant for (ie. receiver's `<function-revision>`)
	- public key of receiver's leader function: `leaders/<function-revision>/publicKey`
- What does a function need to decrypt incoming message?
	- the actual message
	- the re-encryption key: `members/<function-revision>/<leader-pod-id>/<pod-id>/reEncryptionKey`
	- it's own `pre-` private key to decrypt the re-encrypted message
- other functions in the cluster only need watch for public keys of leader functions: `leaders/*/publicKey`

- Data Structures 
	- leader? 
	- member
		- For encryption: 
			- only needs the leader public keys
			- `map[functionRevision][]*pre.PublicKey`
			- to handle re-election: always use the most recent public key
		- For decryption: 
			- needs the re-encryption key
			- `map[functionRevision][]{LeaderId string, ReEncryptionKey *pre.ReEncryptionKey}`
			- to handle re-election: use the previous re-encryption keys if decryption fails
